# Chrome-Extension-For-Procrastinator
Project is still in progress, but this chrome extension
is supposed to make procrastinators spend less time on
social media sites.

# Build Phase
I'll work on this project in two phases:
1) Build a timer feature that starts running when a social
media site is opened
2) Overlay media to the site upon time conditions 
3) Add feature where users can key in what are the sites 
they waste time on
